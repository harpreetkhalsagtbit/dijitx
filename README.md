##Widgets

###Fieldset
This is a widget to introduce `<fieldset>` into Dojo.

###AutofillCheckBox
An extension of Dijit's ````CheckBox```` for Autofilling a group of Dijit Widgets with values from another group of Dijit Widgets. Useful in cases like **"Tick if Billing Address and Home Adress are the same"**.
